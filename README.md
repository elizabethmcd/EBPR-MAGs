# Extracting Metagenome-Assembled Genomes from EBPR Enrichment Reactor Time-Series

This series of workflows demonstrate how to extract, refine, and utilize metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from a metagenomic time-series of EBPR reactors. Most of the workflow was constructed to be run on a high-throughput computing system, specifically HT-Condor systems such as [CHTC at UW-Madison](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) and the WEI cluster. These steps describe the filtering, assembly, refinement, classification, and annotation steps of using metagenome assembled genomes, and using them for a metatranscriptomics analysis.
